            <p> The largest ever mod that enabled Coop for Escape from Tarkov offline. This mod was written from scatch using a combination .NET, Typescript, Node & Reverse Engineering.  </p>
            <p> This mod had my heart and soul poured into it and after 2 years achieved it's goal at succesfully replicating Live experience. </p>
            <p> Learned a tremendous amount about <code>Open Source Project Management</code>, <code>Branching</code>, <code>GitHub Actions</code>, <code>Unity Game Engine</code> and <code>Game Networking</code>.</p>
            <p> This project is <code>open source</code> and actively forked by other groups. I left it on GitHub under the leadership of other great developers</p>
